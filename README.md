# YAML to iCalendar (ics)

| WARNING: this project is still in beta. Beware of breaking changes! |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Convert YAML files to .ics files which can be imported into other
calendar applications.

Features include:

- Converting single .yaml files, or combining multiple into one .ics
  file.
- ics fields: name, summary, description, location, timezone, repeat
- Specify event start+end or start+duration
- Recurring events (basic support)
- All-day events
- Timezone specification (default or per-event)

## Installation

```
pip install yaml2ics
```

## Usage

To produce a calendar from a list of events:

```
python yaml2ics.py example/test_calendar.yaml
```

To combine lists of events in to a calendar:

```
python yaml2ics.py example/test_calendar.yaml example/another_calendar.yaml
```

## Syntax

Please see `example/test_calendar.yaml` for a full demo including
explanations. Below is a minimal template that shows the basic idea:

```yaml
name: Calendar Name
timezone: Europe/Helsinki # default timezone for events, optional

events:
  - summary: The event title
    begin: 2021-09-21 15:00:00
